# Melbourne-Targeting-Zero
Problem presented by Glenda Gorrie &amp; Brooke Treacher from the Department of Health and Human Services


# Problem
The DHHS collects a lot of rich and comprehensive data about harm and near-misses in hospitals, however we've never reported back to the sector. There are various technical and design barriers that have caused this

# Proposed Solution
An Open-source database that enables:

* Reporting back to the sector meaningfully
* Abiility to extract meaning from unstructured data
* Provides real-time insights into emerging trends
